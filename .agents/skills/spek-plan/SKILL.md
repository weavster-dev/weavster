# What this skill does

This skill drives a **multi-step interactive workflow** that produces a complete implementation plan in `.spektacular/plans/<name>.md` from an existing spec. The workflow is owned by the `spektacular` CLI, not by you — the CLI is the state machine and you are the executor.

On each turn, the CLI returns JSON containing an `instruction` field. That instruction describes exactly one step (e.g. discovery, data structures, phases, testing approach, …). You must:

1. Read the `instruction` carefully.
2. Perform the step — this may mean researching the codebase, spawning subagents, interviewing the user, or writing a section of the plan file.
3. When the step is complete, run the `goto` command named at the bottom of the instruction to advance the state machine.
4. Read the next `instruction` from the new JSON response and repeat.

**This is a loop. Do not stop after the first step.** Keep looping — step → goto → next instruction → step — until a returned instruction tells you the workflow is *finished*. Only then should you report completion to the user.

# How to start

Spec name: $ARGUMENTS

If no spec name was provided, check `.spektacular/state.json` for an active spec under `data.name`. If one exists, ask the user whether they want to plan against that spec, offering the option to name a different one. If no active spec is found, ask the user which spec to plan against before proceeding.

Specs created by the `spek-new` skill are timestamp-prefixed in the format `<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>-<slug>`. When planning, use the exact spec name, including its timestamp prefix. Do not strip, renumber, or replace the prefix.

Start the plan workflow by running:

```
spektacular plan new --data '{"name": "<spec_name>"}'
```

This creates the plan file and state file automatically and returns the first `instruction`. From that point on, follow the loop above: do what the instruction says, then call `spektacular plan goto --data '{"step":"<next_step>"}'` to get the next one. Do not invent step names — every instruction tells you the exact `goto` command to run next.
