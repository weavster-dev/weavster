            Please review this pull request for the Weavster project.

            ## Review Focus Areas

            1. **Rust Best Practices**
               - Proper error handling (thiserror in libs, anyhow in bins)
               - No unwrap() in library code
               - Appropriate use of lifetimes and ownership
               - Idiomatic Rust patterns

            2. **Architecture Compliance**
               - weavster-core has no workspace dependencies
               - weavster-runtime stays minimal (Docker image size matters)
               - Proper separation of concerns between crates

            3. **Code Quality**
               - Tests included for new functionality
               - Doc comments on public APIs
               - No clippy warnings introduced
               - Follows conventional commit format

            4. **Performance Considerations**
               - Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths
               - Proper async usage (no blocking in async context)
               - Efficient serialization/deserialization

            5. **Security**
               - No secrets or credentials in code
               - Safe handling of user input
               - WASM sandboxing maintained for transforms

            ## Review Process

            1. First, minimize any previous Claude review comments:
               ```bash
               for comment_id in $(gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --json comments --jq '.comments[] | select(.author.login == "claude") | .id'); do
                 gh api graphql -f query="mutation { minimizeComment(input: {subjectId: \"$comment_id\", classifier: OUTDATED}) { clientMutationId } }"
               done
               ```

            2. Review the diff:
               ```bash
               gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }}
               ```

            3. Check related issues:
               ```bash
               gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --json body
               ```

            4. Post your review with constructive feedback.
